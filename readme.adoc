The Swagger API specification file is in a <<YAML>> format.  
When used with SwaggerHub it provides excellent on-line documentation and testing services.
However, sometimes a printed version of the swagger <<YAML>> file is needed.
This method produces a PDF file from the Swagger <<YAML>> file.

.Documentation
[quote, How the Internet was created,Tim Berners-Lee]
I basically wrote the code and the specs and documentation for how the client and server talked to each other.



== GIT

This project has a local GIT repository and a GMH private repository.

{github}


== Installation

The Swagger2Markup-CLI Java program can be downloaded from the releases folder at https://jcenter.bintray.com/io/github/swagger2markup/swagger2markup-cli/1.3.3/.  I used the `swagger2markup-cli-1.3.3.jar` file.

I copied and renamed the file to `Swagger2Markdown.jar`.





=== SWAGGER YAML file

The Swagger specification can be saved to a <<YAML>> or a <<JSON>> file format.

=== Swagger2Markup example

The `Release` JAR file can be executed without any compiling.



So for the example in this project

  java -jar ./swagger2markup-cli.jar convert -i cc360-API.yaml -d ./doco/CC360-API.adoc

=== Swagger2Markup

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that’s been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation produced by Swagger. The result is intended to be an up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide, comparable to GitHub’s API documentation. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to swagger-ui and can be served as static content.

NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the Open API Initiative (OAI) and has been renamed to the OpenAPI Specification.

=== Swagger2Markdown CLI

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup-cli

This is a CLI for Swagger2Markup. It converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several AsciiDoc or GitHub Flavored Markdown documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification.
