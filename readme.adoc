The Swagger API specification file is in a <<YAML>> format.  
When used with SwaggerHub it provides excellent on-line documentation and testing services.
However, sometimes a printed version of the swagger <<YAML>> file is needed.
This method produces a PDF file from the Swagger <<YAML>> file.

== Installation

Download the JAVA <<JAR>> file from https://jcenter.bintray.com/io/github/swagger2markup/swagger2markup/.

Copy the JAR file to your Java library or into the project directory.

NOTE: Current version was 1.3.3.  I copies it swagger2markup.jar to allow the script to handle this better.

== GIT

This project has a local GIT repository and a GMH private repository.

=== Swagger2Markdown

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that’s been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation produced by Swagger. The result is intended to be an up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide, comparable to GitHub’s API documentation. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to swagger-ui and can be served as static content.

NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the Open API Initiative (OAI) and has been renamed to the OpenAPI Specification.

=== Swagger2Markdown CLI

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup-cli

This is a CLI for Swagger2Markup. It converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several AsciiDoc or GitHub Flavored Markdown documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification.
