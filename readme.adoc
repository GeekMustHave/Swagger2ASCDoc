The Swagger API specification file is in a <<YAML>> format.  
When used with SwaggerHub it provides excellent on-line documentation and testing services.
However, sometimes a printed version of the swagger <<YAML>> file is needed.
This method produces a PDF file from the Swagger <<YAML>> file.

== Installation

Download the JAVA <<JAR>> file from https://jcenter.bintray.com/io/github/swagger2markup/swagger2markup/.

Copy the JAR file to your Java library or into the project directory.

NOTE: Current version was 1.3.3.  I copied it `swagger2markup.jar` to allow the script to handle this better.

== GIT

This project has a local GIT repository and a GMH private repository.

== SWAGGER YAML file

The Swagger specification can be saved to a <<YAML>> or a <<JSON>> file format.

== GRADLE Build tool

Gradle is a build tool used for Java, C++, Python and other languages.

* The download for the Gradle binary is https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=4.9&format=bin

* Create a new directory `C:\Gradle` with File Explorer.

* Open a second File Explorer window and go to the directory where the Gradle distribution was downloaded. Double-click the ZIP archive to expose the content. Drag the content folder `gradle-4.9` to your newly created `C:\Gradle` folder.

* In File Explorer right-click on the This PC (or Computer) icon, then click Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environmental Variables.

* Under System Variables select Path, then click Edit. Add an entry for `C:\Gradle\gradle-4.9\bin`. Click OK to save.

gradle -v


== Swagger2Markup example

You can clone and build the jar, then use this CLI to generate asciidocs.

 gradle assemble
 java -jar ./build/libs/swagger2markup-cli-X.X.X.jar convert -i the_swagger_file.json -d /the/path/to/output



So for the example in this project

  java -jar ./swagger2markup.jar convert -i cc360-API.yaml -d ./doco/CC360-API.adoc

=== Swagger2Markdown

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that’s been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation produced by Swagger. The result is intended to be an up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide, comparable to GitHub’s API documentation. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to swagger-ui and can be served as static content.

NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the Open API Initiative (OAI) and has been renamed to the OpenAPI Specification.

=== Swagger2Markdown CLI

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup-cli

This is a CLI for Swagger2Markup. It converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several AsciiDoc or GitHub Flavored Markdown documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification.
