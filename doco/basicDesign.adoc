== Basic design considerations

Some of the basic design considerations for this API are defined in this document.

* Reuse existing database objects currently in use by the CareConnect360 web application.
* This API will initially be written for read or retrieval access to the CC360 data sources.
* This API will be hosted on the same platform as the CC360 web application.
* In the future when the State of Michigan migrates to the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
this API must be able to migrate to that environment.
* Security contract will be developed in coordination with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDHHS) security group.
