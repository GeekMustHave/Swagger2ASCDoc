==== Parameters

[options="header", cols=".^2a,.^3a,.^9a,.^4a"]
|===
|Type|Name|Description|Schema
|**Header**|**EHRSystem** +
__required__|==== Description

EHRSystem allows MDHHs to authorize one EHR to make requests while not
authorizing another. The service must supply one of the names recorded in the
web-service DUA as authorized at the requesting planLocation. (ie- 'PCE')

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *Any*.|string
|**Header**|**planID** +
__required__|==== Description

planID and planType combine to uniquely identify organizations within CC360.
They will be retrievable from CC360 via another service. 

Consumer will use this service to populate their map mechanism so that
incoming requests can be translated into the correct CC360 oganization details

==== Mock server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *01*.|string
|**Header**|**planLocation** +
__required__|==== Description

planLocation is provided to allow MDHHs to authorize logical or
geographicalsubsets of an organization, for example- Grand Rapids or Diabetes Support Team.

If the DUA with MDHHS does not identify any authorized subsets,
the parameter will be set to 'ANY'.
If it has any authorized subsets, the consumer must supply
one of those names and cannot use 'ANY'

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *Any*.|string
|**Header**|**planType** +
__required__|==== Description

planID and planType combine to uniquely identify organizations within CC360.
they will be retrievable from CC360 via another service. 

Consumer will use this service to populate their map mechanism
so that incoming requests can be translated into the correct CC360
organization details.

Plan types are strings (ie PIHP, MHP, ICO, ….)

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *CMH*.|string
|**Header**|**userID** +
__required__|==== Description

The name of the user from the Plan causing the API to be
requested by the consumer

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using one user ID for all your tests.|string
|**Header**|**validateACRS** +
__required__|==== Description

Consumer will be reviewing their own records to attempt to establish a
currentcare-relationship between the organization and the beneficiary. 

If it cannot (validAcrs = *False*), it will forward the request,
and a CC360 service will in turn attempt to find a relationship in its
authorization tables, and act according to that result.

If MiHIN can validate the relationship (validAcrs = *True*)
the behaviour of CC360 service will vary between an initial
‘tuning’ phase and long-term production. 

In the tuning phase, a CC360 service will always consult its own
authorization tables and will act according to that value. 

On a daily basis, a reconciliation report will be generated to compare
Consumer and CC360 results, and MDHHS staff will work with Consumer to
understand and correct any variations. Once the variations drop below a
defined threshold (t.b.d), CC360 services will switch to always
respecting any ACRS delivered True assertion.

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *True*.|enum (true, false)
|**Path**|**beneID** +
__required__|==== Description

Returns a list of drill down details for the procedure codes tile


==== Parameters

[options="header", cols=".^2a,.^3a,.^9a,.^4a"]
|===
|Type|Name|Description|Schema
|**Header**|**EHRSystem** +
__required__|==== Description

EHRSystem allows MDHHs to authorize one EHR to make requests while not
authorizing another. The service must supply one of the names recorded in the
web-service DUA as authorized at the requesting planLocation. (ie- 'PCE')

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *Any*.|string
|**Header**|**planID** +
__required__|==== Description

planID and planType combine to uniquely identify organizations within CC360.
They will be retrievable from CC360 via another service. 

Consumer will use this service to populate their map mechanism so that
incoming requests can be translated into the correct CC360 oganization details

==== Mock server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *01*.|string
|**Header**|**planLocation** +
__required__|==== Description

planLocation is provided to allow MDHHs to authorize logical or
geographicalsubsets of an organization, for example- Grand Rapids or Diabetes Support Team.

If the DUA with MDHHS does not identify any authorized subsets,
the parameter will be set to 'ANY'.
If it has any authorized subsets, the consumer must supply
one of those names and cannot use 'ANY'

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *Any*.|string
|**Header**|**planType** +
__required__|==== Description

planID and planType combine to uniquely identify organizations within CC360.
they will be retrievable from CC360 via another service. 

Consumer will use this service to populate their map mechanism
so that incoming requests can be translated into the correct CC360
organization details.

Plan types are strings (ie PIHP, MHP, ICO, ….)

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *CMH*.|string
|**Header**|**userID** +
__required__|==== Description

The name of the user from the Plan causing the API to be
requested by the consumer

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using one user ID for all your tests.|string
|**Header**|**validateACRS** +
__required__|==== Description

Consumer will be reviewing their own records to attempt to establish a
currentcare-relationship between the organization and the beneficiary. 

If it cannot (validAcrs = *False*), it will forward the request,
and a CC360 service will in turn attempt to find a relationship in its
authorization tables, and act according to that result.

If MiHIN can validate the relationship (validAcrs = *True*)
the behaviour of CC360 service will vary between an initial
‘tuning’ phase and long-term production. 

In the tuning phase, a CC360 service will always consult its own
authorization tables and will act according to that value. 

On a daily basis, a reconciliation report will be generated to compare
Consumer and CC360 results, and MDHHS staff will work with Consumer to
understand and correct any variations. Once the variations drop below a
defined threshold (t.b.d), CC360 services will switch to always
respecting any ACRS delivered True assertion.

==== Mock Server

* This parameter is not validated.
* Any value will work.
* Recommend using *True*.|enum (true, false)
|**Path**|**beneID** +
__required__|==== Description

10 digit Bemeficiary Id, zero filled

==== Mock Server

The only Bedneficiary ID's available on the Mock server are 

* *9999999006*
* *9999999957*
 *

These beneficiary ID's do not exist in either the QA ir Production servers.|string
