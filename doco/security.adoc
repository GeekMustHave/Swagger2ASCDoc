planID, planType, planLocation, and planSystem are the header elements used
during connection validation. 

The validation comprises two steps – validation
that the organization has an authorized care relationship with the passed
beneficiary, and validation that the qualified-organization is currently
authorized to use the service at all.

`planID` + `planType` uniquely identifies an organization and can used to
provide an index into the CC360 universe table to validate organization acces.

‘planID + planType + planLocation + planSystem’ uniquely identifies an entry
in the system-access authorization table.
