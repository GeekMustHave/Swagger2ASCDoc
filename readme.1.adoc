The Swagger API specification file is in a <<YAML>> format.  
When used with SwaggerHub it provides excellent on-line documentation and testing services.
However, sometimes a printed version of the swagger <<YAML>> file is needed.
This method produces a PDF file from the Swagger <<YAML>> file.

.Documentation
[quote, How the Internet was created,Tim Berners-Lee]
I basically wrote the code and the specs and documentation for how the client and server talked to each other.

=== Compile the code

To compile the code you will need to the have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.  It is not the same of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The JDK can be found at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html it is 390 MB.  You should also get the match JRE for the JDK.

* jdk-10.0.2_windows-x64_bin.exe - JDK developer Installation
* jre-10.0.2_windows-x64_bin.exe - JRE Runtime environment





Within the directory shown above execute the following command

  gradle assemble

Lots of stuff will flash across the terminal window.

Check the Java Version information

.Java Version
[source,Powershell]
----
PS F:\users\jschust2\Dropbox\myDev\Swagger2Markdown\Swagger2Markup GIT\swagger2markup-master> java -version <1>
java version "1.8.0_161"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode, sharing)
----

<1> Command to execute

The resolution seems to be to locate `gradle.properties` and add a line to point to the java home folder.

NOTE: The `JAVA_HOME` and `java_home` are different things.

Here is the location of the java home directory on my development system.

.Java Home directorty
image::gradlejavahome.png[Java Home directorty, align='center']

Make the following change to the `gradle.properties` file

.gradle.properies change
image::gradleproperties.png[gradle.properies change, align='center']
 



 





=== JAVA ????

Download the JAVA <<JAR>> file from https://jcenter.bintray.com/io/github/swagger2markup/swagger2markup/.

Copy the JAR file to your Java library or into the project directory.

NOTE: Current version was 1.3.3.  I copied it `swagger2markup.jar` to allow the script to handle this better.

=== GRADLE Build tool

Gradle is a build tool used for Java, C++, Python and other languages.

* The download for the Gradle binary is https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=4.9&format=bin

* Create a new directory `C:\Gradle` with File Explorer.

* Open a second File Explorer window and go to the directory where the Gradle distribution was downloaded. Double-click the ZIP archive to expose the content. Drag the content folder `gradle-4.9` to your newly created `C:\Gradle` folder.

* In File Explorer right-click on the This PC (or Computer) icon, then click Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environmental Variables.

* Under System Variables select Path, then click Edit. Add an entry for `C:\Gradle\gradle-4.9\bin`. Click OK to save.

<1> Command to enter


=== SWAGGER YAML file

The Swagger specification can be saved to a <<YAML>> or a <<JSON>> file format.

link:CC360-api.yaml[Swagger YAML Example]




=== Swagger2Markup example

You can clone and build the jar, then use this CLI to generate asciidocs.

 gradle assemble
 java -jar ./build/libs/swagger2markup-cli-X.X.X.jar convert -i the_swagger_file.json -d /the/path/to/output



So for the example in this project

  java -jar ./swagger2markup.jar convert -i cc360-API.yaml -d ./doco/CC360-API.adoc

=== Swagger2Markdown

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that’s been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation produced by Swagger. The result is intended to be an up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide, comparable to GitHub’s API documentation. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to swagger-ui and can be served as static content.

NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the Open API Initiative (OAI) and has been renamed to the OpenAPI Specification.

=== Swagger2Markdown CLI

https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup-cli

This is a CLI for Swagger2Markup. It converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several AsciiDoc or GitHub Flavored Markdown documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification.
